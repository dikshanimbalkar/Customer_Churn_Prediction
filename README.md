# Bank_Customer_Churn_Prediction:

1. Project Overview

• Objective: To predict customer churn on banking attributes and analyze the key factors 
that contribute to customer churn.

• Dataset: A dataset with 10,000 records containing customer information such as credit 
score, geography, age, balance, and several categorical attributes like card type.

2. Data Import and Initial Exploration
• Libraries Used: Imported essential libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Plotly
for data handling and visualization. Also imported Scikit-learn for model building and evaluation.

3. Data Understanding
   
• Displayed first few rows with df.head() and checked data types using df.dtypes.

• Verified dataset shape (df.shape) and checked for null values (df.isnull().sum()), 
which indicated there were no missing values.
